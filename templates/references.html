      <p>During my time at Strata Fund Solutions I worked directly under a supervisor, Patrick Wigger, as well as a manager, Albert Li. They each provided me with a recommendation on LinkedIn. I've provided their recommendations below as well as their LinkedIn
        profiles.</p>

          <p class="referenceParagraph"><br>I have trained a lot of people since I've been at Strata, and Brenner was by far one of the best analysts I've ever worked with. Brenner displayed more drive than most to develop the skills and knowledge necessary to work on his own, to
            create, streamline and develop processes, and produce quality work. Despite not being an accounting major, his base knowledge of the field and of excel, as well as an extremely strong work ethic helped him find success here.</p>

          <p class="referenceParagraph">One of the top attributes I look for in my staff is to have the right attitude towards their career. I look for someone who is a team player, who is willing to put in the time necessary to ensure everything is complete and correct, and who has
            a positive influence on those who he or she works with. Brenner has these qualities in spades.</p>

          <p class="referenceParagraph">As an example, we assigned Brenner to work on a client whose work was run primarily from Excel. During the period of time Brenner was assigned to this client and with little to no supervision, he was able to transition the work, including all
            historical data, to our main accounting system. This, as well as the adjustments Brenner made to the process, dramatically improved the turnaround time and reduced the potential for human error present in the existing process. His natural
            inquisitiveness helped him to quickly learn the nuances of the specific client work and point out weak points in the process. As a result, the client is now one of the higher revenue per hour clients in the firm.</p>

          <p class="referenceParagraph">We are devastated to lose Brenner, not only for the work that he does, but because he has been a pleasure to know as a person. We wish him the best as he moves on to new adventures and opportunities!</p>

          <p class="referenceParagraph"><br>Brenner reported directly to me for about 18 months as an analyst with Strata Fund Solutions. His primary responsibilities including preparing US GAAP compliant financial statements, coordinating client audits, investment reconciliations,
            and various database/system management that was related to fund administration. He worked in endowment reporting, private equity, fund of funds, and hedge funds. He also communicated directly with clients as a point of contact for financial
            questions or systems support for online reporting. I supervised and directly reviewed the work he prepared.</p>

          <p class="referenceParagraph">It was a great pleasure to work with him over the course of that 18 months. I appreciated mostly his ability as a self-starter on projects, as well as his eagerness to develop new processes and find more efficient ways of improving existing
            ones. Brenner never required any sort of micromanagement as he was keenly aware of client deadlines and never missed one. He was always open to feedback as well, taking ownership and accountability for the client work he prepared and his day
            to day activities. He didn’t just accept projects handed to him, he made them his own and especially with client needs ensured requests were met in prompt fashion. He also was an excellent critical thinker, looking through impacts of projects
            and the work he did as well as client requests. Brenner has an inspired thirst for knowledge and it came through his work at Strata. Lastly, he was always on-point when it came to ad-hoc requests from other analysts, as the saying goes the
            cream always rises to the top and he was certainly our top analyst on our team.</p>

          <p class="referenceParagraph">Brenner’s impact is already missed at Strata, and we wish him well in his endeavors abroad. He was on course to have a mid-year promotion and movement towards a more supervisory role within our firm, and I personally and professionally would
            recommend him at any firm that needs his talents.</p>
